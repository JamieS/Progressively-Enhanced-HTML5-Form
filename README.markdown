This is a demo of progressively enhancing an HTML5 form. We'll use native HTML5 features when
they are available, and JavaScript fallbacks when they are not. This is using [Modernizr](http://www.modernizr.com/) for 
feature detection, [Yepnope](http://yepnopejs.com/) (built together with Modernizr into a single script) to load scripts 
and CSS as needed, and jQuery for funzies.
